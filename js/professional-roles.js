// Darwesh Group -- the ONE capability map for professional roles.
//
// Two INDEPENDENT axes, deliberately not collapsed into a single "is a
// professional" flag:
//
//   profileMedia  may this role have an avatar + cover image and a premium
//                 public profile?  -- true for every role.
//   posts         may this role publish a visual portfolio
//                 (professionalPosts)?  -- false for lawyer, by decision.
//
// A lawyer has the first and not the second: legal work is not a photo
// gallery. One flag could not express that; two can. Educational/legal
// articles may arrive later as their own text-shaped content type -- that
// is not this map's `posts`, which specifically means the image-led
// project gallery.
//
// NOT IN THIS MAP, and deliberately so:
//   office             companies/{id}. Has a profile, listings and estate
//                      content already. Office news/projects, if ever
//                      wanted, is a dedicated feature -- never this feed.
//                      (Preserves docs/PROFESSIONAL_CONTENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
//                      §9 rather than reversing it.)
//   real_estate_agent  users/{uid}.role. An agent's portfolio IS their
//                      listings; a second content identity for the same
//                      person is exactly the duplication §9 warns about.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// MIRRORED IN firestore.rules. Rules cannot import JavaScript, so the role
// list below is duplicated in that file's serviceProviders serviceType
// enum. tests/firestore/phase3a_profile_media.test.mjs asserts the two
// match, so a drift fails CI instead of silently opening or closing a role.
// If you add a role here, add it there in the same commit.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// PHASE 3A SCOPE NOTE: `posts` is descriptive of the approved design, NOT
// of what firestore.rules currently permits. professionalPosts is still
// gated to profileType == 'designer' and this phase does not touch it.
// Every other role's `posts: true` becomes real only in the phase that
// follows the server-side rate limiter -- see the approved Phase 3C.
// Nothing reads this field yet; it exists so the map is complete and the
// drift guard has something stable to check.

// PHASE 3B added `portfolio`, `icon` and `accountType` to each entry.
//
// `portfolio` is a THIRD independent axis, and the one Phase 3B actually
// enforces in the UI: may this role show a visual gallery of past work on
// its profile? It is not the same question as `posts`:
//
//   posts      may the role publish to professionalPosts -- the future,
//              moderated, rate-limited feed. Still Designer-only in
//              firestore.rules; nothing in Phase 3B changes that.
//   portfolio  may the role's profile show a visual project gallery AT
//              ALL, from any source (professionalPosts for Designer, the
//              legacy serviceProviders.portfolio array for the others).
//
// A lawyer is false on both. Before Phase 3B, js/profile-role.js rendered
// providerData.portfolio for EVERY role that did not supply a custom work
// tab -- which included lawyer.html. So a lawyer profile had a Projects
// tab with a photo grid, contradicting the approved decision that legal
// work is not a photo gallery. Gating on this flag is what makes that
// decision structural instead of a comment.
