// ------------------------------------
//  * It never decides an outcome. Capture quality is assessed here only
//    so someone can retake a blurry photo before a reviewer wastes a
//    day on it -- a "usable" image is not an approved one, and the word
//    "verified" is never rendered as a result of anything on this page.
//  * It never claims a submission that did not happen (§BI). If the
//    endpoint is not deployed, the page says exactly that and stays on
//    the review screen; it does not show the success state.
//  * It never sends image bytes to the backend. Bytes go to the
//    person's OWN private Storage prefix, which storage.rules scopes to
//    their uid; the backend is told only the object id, the kind, a
//    content hash and any readability issues.
